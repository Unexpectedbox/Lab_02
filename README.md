# Lab_02

Started with #include so that the input and output could be produced

Used int main to store the code.

Used "using std" on cout, cin, and endl, so I don't have to write it every time.

Used cout on all my sentences so that they are read as output.

Used cin to store the user input

Used int to store that number

Used if and else if statements to give multiple end results

Gave 3 possible endings depending on user input 

Ended all my lines with endl.

Used return 0 to see if the code worked.
